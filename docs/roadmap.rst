Roadmap
=======

This document outlines the future direction and planned features for the Context Engineering Framework.

.. note::
   This is a living document that will be updated as the project evolves. The features and timelines mentioned here are subject to change based on community feedback and contributions.

Current Focus (v0.1.0)
----------------------

- **Core Framework**: Stabilize the core agent and context management systems
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Testing**: Improve test coverage and add integration tests
- **CLI**: Basic command-line interface for interacting with agents

Short-term (Next 3-6 months)
----------------------------

- **Plugin System**: Allow for dynamic loading of agents, tools, and context providers
- **Web Interface**: Basic web-based interface for interacting with agents
- **More Built-in Tools**: Add commonly used tools for file I/O, web requests, etc.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Profile and optimize critical paths
- **Enhanced Context Management**: Better support for large context sets

Medium-term (6-12 months)
-------------------------

- **Distributed Agents**: Support for agents running on different machines
- **Persistence**: Save and load agent state
- **Advanced Tooling**: Visual debugging and monitoring tools
- **Integration**: Better integration with popular AI platforms and frameworks
- **Security**: Enhanced security features for production use

Long-term (1+ years)
--------------------

- **Federated Learning**: Allow agents to learn from each other
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Support for complex multi-agent architectures
- **Self-improving Agents**: Agents that can modify their own behavior
- **Standardization**: Contribute to standards for agent interoperability

Feature Requests
----------------

If you have ideas for new features, please open an issue on GitHub with the "enhancement" label. Be sure to include:

1. A clear description of the feature
2. The problem it solves
3. Any relevant use cases
4. Potential implementation ideas (if any)

Contributing to Development
--------------------------

We welcome contributions to help implement the roadmap! Here's how you can help:

1. Pick an issue labeled "good first issue" if you're new to the project
2. Check the project board for in-progress work
3. Join the discussion in GitHub issues and discussions
4. Submit pull requests with tests and documentation

Release Schedule
----------------

We aim to release new versions on a regular schedule:

- **Patch releases** (0.1.x): As needed for bug fixes
- **Minor releases** (0.x.0): Every 2-3 months with new features
- **Major releases** (x.0.0): When there are breaking changes

Dependencies
------------

We aim to keep dependencies minimal and well-maintained. When adding new dependencies, please consider:

1. Is the dependency actively maintained?
2. Does it follow semantic versioning?
3. What is its license compatibility?
4. What is its impact on installation size and performance?

Deprecation Policy
------------------

- Features will be deprecated for at least one minor version before removal
- Deprecated features will be clearly marked in the documentation
- Migration guides will be provided when possible
- Breaking changes will be avoided in patch releases

Feedback
--------

Your feedback is valuable! Please share your thoughts on:

- What features are most important to you
- Any pain points in the current implementation
- Ideas for improvement
- Your use cases and requirements

You can provide feedback by:

1. Opening an issue on GitHub
2. Starting a discussion in the GitHub discussions
3. Contacting the maintainers directly
